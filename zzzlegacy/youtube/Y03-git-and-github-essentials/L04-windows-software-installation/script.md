Hello, and, welcome back…

So, there are a couple of ways you can participate in this course.

You can of course just watch the vidoes, but you may want to follow along and copy what I'm doing on your own machine.

If you want to do that, then you'll need a few bits of software installed.

To help you with that, I've written some notes and also recorded some videos to show you

- how do install the software
  and also
- how my Visual Studio Code is configured.

Information on exactly where to find those notes and videos is in the course repo…

There is a link to the course repo in the show notes for every lesson.

So for instance, here's lesson one, and if you just scroll down a little bit, you'll find these links underneath.

And the first one is a link to the course repo on the GitHub website.

Lets just follow it now ...

By the time I've finished recording this course you should find a folder for each lesson.

So here is the current lesson : lesson four, Windows software installation.

Inside, you'll find a readme file. And if you open that readme file, you'll get the latest version of the installation instructions.

I'm doing it this way just to make sure that I can keep everything continuously updated.

So, just go there, follow the instructions, and

once you've got the software installed, come back to this course and

in the next lesson, lesson three, we'll look at a couple of essential Git settings

So I'll see you then

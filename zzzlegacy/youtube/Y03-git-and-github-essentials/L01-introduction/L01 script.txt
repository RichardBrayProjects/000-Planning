Hello, and welcome. 

This is a short tutorial on Git and GitHub essentials.

In front of you is a quick summary of the lessons coming up. 

In the first column you can see these are lessons on getting the correct software installed and your machine correctly configured.

Then, in the second column are three lessons on how to create a repo, make some commits and navigating around the github.com website. 

In the last column there are three lessons on how to use branches 
  - both for going back to a previous state of your repo 
  - as well as creating a branch for some experimental changes before committing them.

Let's quickly go to the Git website. There's this Learn section, and within it a book,

The book is actually available as a sort of normal book, but it's also available on the website, and it's really excellent. 

For instance, this is the chapter on Git branching, 

If we look at the first section you can see, there are lots of nice, pretty pictures explaining what's going on under the hood.

Now, whilst this book is a fantastic reference, this tutorial is designed to show you the basics and get you up and running quickly.

Returning to the content there are separate sections for setting up a Mac or Windows PC so I will see you on one of those next.

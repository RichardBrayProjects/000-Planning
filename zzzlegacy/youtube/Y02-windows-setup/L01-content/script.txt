Hello, and welcome. 

This is the first of a few very short videos showing you 

how I went about setting up my Windows PC prior to the various courses 

If all the applications you need for your course are already installed then there's not really any need to go any further. 

But if you're missing some of them then you might find this helpful.

Here, I will walk you through a very efficient way to install all the command line utilities and applications you need.

I'll actually be using the Chocolatey package manager for that.

You can of course install everything individually: just by 

going to various websites and downloading and installing everything individually. 

But of late I've found myself using Chocolatey more and more, just because its a lot quicker and simpler.

Basically, With Chocolatey you can install a whole bunch of applications with a single command.

So in this video well will install Chocolatey - it'll only take a few seconds - 

and then in the next video I will show you how to install the actual applications.

Once that's done there's a few short videos walking you through how Visual Studio code is configured in the course videos.

But first, lets start by installing Chocolatey.

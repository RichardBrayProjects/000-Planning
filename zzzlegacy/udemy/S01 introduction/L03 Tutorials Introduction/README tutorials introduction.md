```
This is a tutorial on xxx.

It's here because different people are coming on to this course with different skill sets.

The idea is to create a level playing field where everyone has the skills required for the main course.

This allows the main course to focus on the main goal of AWS and website development without

 branching out to teach other skills which would be quite distracting.

So if you've, you're you're familiar with the xxxx, then, of course, you can just skip over this whole tutorial.

But if you're not, I've designed them to cover precisely the information you need to know for this course.

So they're not general purpose courses in their subjects, but rather short tutorials very much focused on making sure you're ready for the main course.

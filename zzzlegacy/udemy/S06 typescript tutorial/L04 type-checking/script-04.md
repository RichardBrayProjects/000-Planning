Hello and welcome back

In this lesson we will be looking at what TypeScript adds to JavaScript.

Generally

- TypeScript's main purpose is to allow you to "annotate" JavaScript code with "type" information ...

- Because TypeScript is in simple terms just a JavaScript program with some type information added, TypeScript is often known as a "superset of JavaScript"

- TypeScript comes with two pieces of software :

    1. A TypeChecker - which is constantly scanning the code in your editor and reports any errors it spots

    2. A "Transpiler" - this is a program which takes your TypeScript program and converts it into a JavaScript program.
         In simple terms all this conversion involves is removing the type information.

    There are actually two types of transpilers :

        A. Those which do lots of error checking and report errors (eg. the tsc compiler)

        B. Those which just remove the extra type information as quickly as possible and don't do any type checking (e.g esbuild)


Once a transpiler has converted the TypeScript code to JavaScript it is that Javascript which is then run in your browser if its a front end app or in Node if its a backend app.

Lets hava a look at an example here in

---------
Part One
---------

In the code cell you can see code similar to lesson one

Again I've used const to declare three variables, but this time I've added type information.

The type information is
- the colon string on the first line
- the colon number on the second line
- the colon boolean on the third line

This type information is stating our intentions

We intend that userName should only hold strings

and likewise that userAge should only hold numbers

and isActive only hold booleans

TypeScript will now check to make sure that
whenever these variables are on the left hand side of an assignment
(i.e. whenever they are on the left hand side of a single equals sign)
That whatever is being assigned to them is of the correct type

So here 'Arty' is a string, 25 is a number and true is a boolean so all is well.

But look what happens if I change 25 to true

(MAKE TEMPORARTY CHANGE 25 to true)

Notice how this error is reported before we'd ever run the program

This is knows as static type checking

and the error checking gives us a chance to fix bugs before we run the program.

That is in essence the whole point of TypeScript.

Lets run it now.

PLAY

When this code is tranpiled it produces the JavaScript shown

in the markdown cell below the code cell here ...

This is legal JavaScript and it runs successfully.

Just to reiterate : TypeScripts type annotations only exist at development time to catch errors before runtime.

Lets move on to

------
PART 2
------

Here we can see that port is annotated with colon string

This indicates our intention that port should hold a string.

However, we are initialzing it with 3001 which is of type number

The TypeScript type checker running in the background reports this as an error.

Also, if we were to transpile this with the TypeScript tsc compiler it would also generate the same error.

This is clearly indicating that there is a potential for a bug here and the onus is on us to fix it.

But, lets not fix it and run the program anyway.

PLAY

So what happens when we run the program ?

Well first of all the TypeScript is transpiled to JavaScript - and type information is removed in the process.

I have shown below what is left : a couple of lines of legal Javascript
port equals 3001
and then a backtick string displaying the value of the port

So, the upshot is that there are no errors at runtime ...

But, with TypeScript we do have static type checking errors at develoment time.

Lets move on to

------
PART 3
-------

Another thing TypeScript checks for is whether variables are allowed to change or not

There are two ways to declare variables: using let and const"

In this code example task is declared with **let**
   which means it is allowed to change and be reassigned to new values over and over again

appName on the other hand is declared with **const**
   which means that after its initialize witha value is not allowed to change after that

In the example cell below let me remove that comment

See how the type checker reports an error saying that we can't assign to appName because its a const

Lets run the cell and see what happens

We get a runtime error saying assignment to a constant variable.

This is because we have not only broken a TypeScript rule but we have also broken a JavaScript rule.

The rules around const are actually part of the JavaScript language

If you take a look here : at the JavaScript code which is generated by the transpiler

All that has happened is that the the :number and :string have been removed.

However, the const and let declarations still exist and that's why we got the runtime error.

Lastly, moving on to

-------
PART 4
-------

a quick word about type inference.

Take a look at the first line of code where inferredName 
    - firstly note that inferredName is declared to be of type string
    - secondly we are assigning to inferredName the value Billy which is of type string 
and everything is okay so far

However, the the following line of code we are trying to assign a number and getting an error

So this is just another example of breaking the type rules.

But let me show you what is meant by type inference

If I remove colon string lets see what happens 

Well .. the type checker is still showing the error.

And the reason is that the TypeScript type checker SEES that we are assigning Billy - as string - to inferredName

And so it infers that the type of inferredName is string ...
 essentially assigning a string is equivalent to the type annotation  : string I just removed

So, in summary, in this case TypeScript infers the type at initialization time 

and checks for the type safety throughout the lifetime of the variable inferredName thereafter.

Ok so that ends this lesson on Type Checking 

And I'll' see you in the next.
